- Users add shifts to the day and can assign predefined sections or create sections e.g. Dispensary, Shop Floor, Cosmetics, Vaccinations etc. 
- Users set their opening hours and this adjusts the hours displayed on the roster. This way if you're only opening from 9 to 5 pm you're only seeing 9 to 5 on the roster not 12am to 12pm etc. In the example above I have said they open 9–9:30pm
- Users set interval e.g. 15 mins, 30 mins, or 60 mins. In the example above I have imagined they set it to 30 minute intervals so they can roster 9:30–12:30 etc.
- Daily Budget is prefilled in the budget row by Budget / 7. Users can then adjust this up or down, but the week must equal the Budget. e.g. if my daily budget is 500, but I increase Monday's to 550 because I know this is my busiest day I must decrease another day/s but a total of 50. This can be displayed to the user by a Variance at the end of the daily budget row (now $0 in example)
- Since we are not assigning team members, yet we will need to use an average hourly wage target for the calculations
